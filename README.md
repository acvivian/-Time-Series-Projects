The research project analyzed US Total Natural Gas Consumption data from January 2008 to December 2020. The data revealed a clear seasonality trend alongside an overall growth pattern. To make the data stationary, detrending methods were employed. Candidate time series models were fitted, including Linear Model with Seasonal components and Linear with Seasonal and Time Components. Model diagnostics, such as ACF, PACF, and EACF plots, aided in selecting the most suitable models. The chosen Quadratic Model showcased the best fit based on BIC and RSE values. Further diagnostics supported the adequacy of the AR(1) model for predicting natural gas consumption, considering its residuals and stationarity. Ultimately, the AR(1) model was used to forecast consumption for the next three years (i.e 2021-2023)
